INTRODUCTION                                 *fuzzee*

Install fuzzee.vim into ~/.vim/plugins/ and fuzzee.txt into
~/.vim/doc/ or use vim-pathogen and install into your designated
bundles folder.


USAGE                                        *fuzzee-usage*

Fuzzee.vim has different commands but they all accept the same type of
fuzzy-name argument. Any arg to |:F| can be a typed string that, when
expanded, returns some filename or directory on your system. For example,
|:F| ~/lo/p/t/f   would return  '/Users/you/long/path/to/foo.txt'
|:F| ~/long*foot  also works as well

You don't always have to type in a full path - arguments can be
relative paths instead of absolute ones. Say you're currently editing a file
in '~/long/path' called 'bar.txt' and you wanted to edit the 'foo.txt' from
the previous example. Since it's in a directory below the current one, use
|:F| to/fo  to reach 'to/foo.txt'
|:F| *foot  is a globbed version


ARGUMENTS                                     *fuzzee-arguments*

This plugin can glob for 3 types of fuzzy-typed arguments:
    * Those relative to the current buffer
    * Arguments relative to the current working directory
    * Absolute paths

:F [args]                       Fuzzy-complete any filepath relative to the
                                current buffer, the working directory, or any
                                absolute path and execute 'edit'.

:F ../[args]                    Fuzzy-complete any args relative to the
                                directory above the current buffer.

:F ./[args]                     Fuzzy-complete any args relative to the
                                current working directory.

:F [directory]                  Fuzzy-complete any absolute directory with
                                ~ ` or / as it's first character or any
                                relative directory and execute 'edit',
                                opening up the the explorer. If the last
                                character is / then open the first match
                                inside that directory.

:F `
:F ~                            Complete starting at the user's '$HOME'
                                directory.

:F /                            Complete starting at the root directory.

                                             *fuzzee-globbing*
:F *                            Look for anything after * in any directory
                                under the current buffer.

:F */                           Look for anything after */ in any directory
                                under the current working directory.



COMMANDS                                     *fuzzee-commands*

Each of these commands perform a different task but they all execute on the
same type of arguments. All of these accept any relative, absolute, or globbed
filenames and directories for which to open quickly. If blank, they open up
the explorer which is netrw by default. You can use |:F| from the explorer as
well as the arguments by default are relative to the current working directory.

                                             *fuzzee-:F*
:F                              With no arguments, open up the directory above
                                the current buffer. Otherwise, this tab
                                completes to the current buffer's
                                directory. However, you can give it any
                                fuzzy name of a file or pathname defined in
                                the arguments section above.

:F .                            Open the current working directory.

                                             *fuzzee-:FS*
:FS                             Open in a split. With no arguments, this
                                splits to the directory above the current
                                buffer.

                                             *fuzzee-:FV*
:FV                             Open in a vertical split. With no arguments,
                                this splits vertically to the directory above
                                the current buffer.

                                             *fuzzee-:FT*
:FT                             Open in a new tab. With no arguments, this
                                opens to the directory above the current
                                buffer.

                                             *fuzzee-:FL*
:FL                             Changes local directory |:lcd| to a given
                                argument.

                                             *fuzzee-:FC*
:FC                             Changes working directory |:cd| to a given
                                argument.

                                             *fuzzee-:FB*
:FB                             Search the 'buflist' for a buffer using a
                                fuzzy string in any part of it's relative or
                                full path.  Will use the |:sb| command if your
                                'switchbuf' setting isn't set to the default
                                value ("").
                                            
:FuzzeeMap <cmap> <path>                     *FuzzeeMap*
                                Create a 'cmap' that will use the 'wcm' to
                                auto-complete a mapping inside a specific
                                path, or if given no argument, insert that
                                path. Like everything else, uses 'wildmode'.


FUNCTIONS                                    *fuzzee-functions*

Functions defined in autoload/fuzzee.vim can be used as an interface to set
preferences to the Fuzzee plugin directly inside of your 'vimrc'.

fuzzee#map('cmap', 'path')                   *fuzzee-map*
                                Creates a custom 'cmap' exactly the same as
                                |FuzzeeMap|  but the passed arguments must be
                                surrounded in single-quotes.


TIPS                                         *fuzzee-tips*

Fuzzee.vim can be used to navigate common paths and files quickly. If your
typing out paths to filesnames quite often, mappings can shortcut them for
you. Remember - these paths are shorter if they are local to the current
working directory or buffer. See 'lcd' on how to configure this and use
|:FL| to navigate quickly.

It is highly recommended you do not use the 'autochdir' option. That
changes the 'cwd' to always refer to the current buffer, losing any track
of a "working directory" for your projects. |:F| works best when used
against buffers and the 'cwd'.

Globbing is only as fast the more  information that you give it. With each
character before and after * then Vim will be able to find your file
more quickly.

The |:FB| command can be helpful for finding files in other tabs or a
file that has been recently opened in the current Vim session. Use the
'switchbuf' setting to navigate open and hidden files.

FuzzeeMap is very useful for navigating to the same directories without
having to type much of the path.

See the README for more information, examples, and tricks.


ABOUT                                        *fuzzee-about*

This plugin is used to leverage 'edit' with fuzzy-completion both local to
the current buffer, the current working directory, and any specified path.
It also uses any 'wildignore' settings for faster globbing with *
