INTRODUCTION                                 *fuzzee*

Install in ~/.vim or use vim-pathogen and install into ~/.vimbundles.

USAGE                                        *fuzzee-usage*

Fuzzee.vim has only one command, |:F|. It doesn't require any arguments, but
some arguments have special connotation.

                                             *fuzzee-:F* 
:F                              Open up |:Explore| on the current buffer.

                                             *fuzzee-:FS*
:FS                             Open up in a split. With no arguments, this
                                calls |:Sexplore|.
                                            
                                             *fuzzee-:FV*
:FV                             Open up in a vertical split. With no
                                arguments, this calls |:Vexplore|.

                                             *fuzzee-:FT*
:FT                             Open up in a new tab. With no arguments, this
                                calls |:Texplore|.

                                             *fuzzee-:FL*
:FL [directory]                 Changes local directory |:lcd| to a given
                                argument.

                                             *fuzzee-:FC*
:FC [directory]                 Changes working directory |:cd| to a given
                                argument.

                                             *fuzzee-arguments*
:F .                            Open up |:Explore| on the current Vim working
                                directory.

:F ` 
:F ~                            Complete to the user's '$HOME' directory.

                                             *fuzzee-globbing*
:F *                            Look for anything after * in any directory
                                under the current buffer.

:F */                           Look for anything after */ in any directory
                                under the current working directory.

:F [args]                       Fuzzy-complete any args relative to the current
                                buffer and execute 'edit'.

:F ../[args]                    Fuzzy-complete any args relative to the
                                directory above the current buffer. 

:F [directory]                  Fuzzy-complete any directory with '/' as it's
                                first character and execute 'edit' on them,
                                opening up the the explorer. If the last
                                character is '/', open the first match inside
                                that directory.

TIPS                                         *fuzzee-tips*

Fuzzee.vim can be used to navigate common paths and files quickly. If your
typing out paths to filesnames quite often, mappings can shortcut them for
you. Remember - these paths are local to the current working directory or
buffer. Use |:lcd| to configure this. 

Globbing is only as fast as the information that you give it. With each
character before and after *, Vim will find your file quicker. Be careful with
globbing as it increases the chances you won't find the correct file.

See the README for more information.

ABOUT                                        *fuzzee-about*

This plugin is used simply to leverage 'edit' with fuzzy-completion both local
to the current buffer and any specified path. It also uses any 'wildignore'
settings.
